## Overview

High-level learning flow:

Foundations → Automation (DevOps core) → Linux & Networking → Security (DevSecOps) → Cloud tooling

DSA runs in parallel as a short daily practice to strengthen fundamentals useful for automation and debugging.

---

## Phases

### Phase 1 — Foundations (2–3 weeks)

What to learn

- Variables & data types
- Lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries
- Control flow: conditions & loops
- Functions
- File handling (read/write, context managers)
- Exceptions & error handling
- Modules, packages & virtual environments (venv / pip)
- Basic OOP: classes and objects

Why this matters for DevOps

- Build automation scripts
- Parse logs & config files
- Create small CLI tools

Success criteria

- Write small scripts that read/write files and handle errors
- Create a reusable module and run it inside a virtual env

### Phase 2 — Automation (DevOps Core) (3–4 weeks)

Core topics

- Process & OS: `os`, `sys`, `subprocess`, `shutil`
- Config & data: JSON, YAML
- Text processing: `re` (regex)
- CLI interfaces: `argparse` / `click`
- Environment variables & secrets handling
- Logging with `logging`

Typical exercises

- Disk usage monitor
- Service health check script
- Log parser with alerting hooks
- Simple cron-style automation

Recommended resources

- "Python for DevOps" — Noah Gift (book)
- TechWorld with Nana — automation tutorials

### Phase 3 — Linux & Networking with Python (2–3 weeks)

Networking topics

- Sockets (TCP/UDP basics)
- DNS lookups, HTTP requests
- Basic packet concepts (intro only)

Useful libraries

- `socket`, `requests`, `paramiko` (SSH)
- `psutil` for process/resource info
- `netmiko` for network devices (optional)

Hands-on examples

- SSH into many servers and run commands
- Port scanning and open-port checks (ethical testing only)
- Network latency monitors and API health checks

### Phase 4 — Security & DevSecOps Scripting (3–4 weeks)

Security topics

- Password strength & hashing
- Token handling & secure storage
- API security basics
- Basic vulnerability scanning concepts

Libraries to learn

- `hashlib`, `bcrypt`, `cryptography`, `scapy`, `python-nmap`

Project ideas

- Port scanner (lab-only)
- Brute-force detection from logs
- TLS certificate expiry checker
- IAM permission audit scripts

Recommended learning

- "Black Hat Python" (networking & automation chapters)
- John Hammond / IppSec (video content)
- PortSwigger Web Security Academy — conceptual learning: https://portswigger.net/web-security

⚠️ Always test security tooling on your own infrastructure, labs, or explicitly permitted targets.

### Phase 5 — Cloud & DevOps Tooling with Python (ongoing)

Cloud SDKs & tools

- AWS: `boto3`
- Azure: `azure-sdk`
- GCP: `google-cloud-*`

Integrations

- Terraform automation + Python wrappers
- Kubernetes API client for audits & automation
- CI/CD scripting and GitHub Actions automation

Example uses

- Auto-scale EC2 based on custom metrics
- Periodic cleanup of unused cloud resources
- Kubernetes health and security audits

---

## Parallel — DSA for DevOps (30–45 min/day)

You don't need competitive-level speed; focus on fundamentals that help with debugging and automation logic.

Focus areas

- Arrays & strings
- Hash maps / dictionaries (very important)
- Stacks, queues
- Trees (basic traversal)
- Graphs (BFS / DFS basics)
- Time & space complexity reasoning

Suggested order: Arrays → Strings → HashMaps → Stacks/Queues → Trees → Graphs

Resources: "Grokking Algorithms", NeetCode, Abdul Bari. Practice on LeetCode (easy → medium).

---

## Suggested routine

Weekday (1.5–2 hrs)

- 45 min — Python / DevOps scripting (hands-on)
- 30 min — DSA practice or code kata
- 15 min — Reading docs or watching a short video

Weekend

- Build or extend one mini-project and push to GitHub

---

## Mini-project ideas (progression)

Beginner

- Disk & memory monitor
- Log parser with simple alerts
- Password strength checker

Intermediate

- Multi-server SSH automation tool
- Network port scanner (lab only)
- TLS certificate expiry checker

Advanced

- IAM security audit tool
- Kubernetes security scanner
- Cloud cost optimization script

---

## Recommended repo layout (recruiter-friendly)

```
python-devops/
├── automation/        # scripts and CLI tools
├── networking/        # networking & ssh helpers
├── security/          # security scripts & scanners (lab-only)
├── cloud/             # cloud automation (boto3 / azure / gcp)
├── dsa/               # practice problems + solutions
└── README.md          # this roadmap
```

---

## Notes & ethics

- Keep commits small and descriptive. Push code and short README for each project.
- Never run network or security scans against systems you don't own or have explicit permission to test.
- Use virtual environments to manage dependencies and avoid conflicts.
